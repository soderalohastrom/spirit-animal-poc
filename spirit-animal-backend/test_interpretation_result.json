I enjoy quiet time with a good book or a game of chess, but I also value being around people I care about and genuinely enjoy getting to know others. My sense of humor is understated\u2014more dry observations and well-timed comments than big performances. I appreciate simple things done well, like a good meal or an easy weekend with family, and I tend to bring a calm, thoughtful presence into the spaces I'm part of.",
